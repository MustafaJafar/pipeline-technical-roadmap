# DCC apps and APIs

Any app that we use to create a digital art / content `e.g.3d models`  is called Digial Content Creation app `DCC app`

---

### DCCs APIs
API "Application Programming Interface" defines how to interact with a certain program via coding. 

Example:<br>
You can write a python code that interacts with Maya via Maya API. <br>
In other words : you can write a python code that do some thing (e.g. create new objects) in Maya Scene. 

>But first things first, <br>
>You will need to learn to use any program as an artist before learning how to write code for it <br>
>In other words, you need to learn how to use Maya before digging in and creating Maya Scripts and tools! <br>
> So, Give your self time to learn to use the DCC as an artist first<br>
