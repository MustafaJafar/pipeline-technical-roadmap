# OpenPype Repository

This Repo is studio's **OpenPype Codebase**, [read more](https://openpype.io/docs/admin_distribute#2-openpype-codebase).



## Repo Structure

```
.
├── deployment
├── repository
└── sources
```

### Folders Content

- **deployment** :  `openPype update location` which used for **Automatic Updates**
  
- **sources**  : it contains a source version for each deployed version.
  
- **repository** : it contains **OpenPype Local Repository**

<br>

>Note : <br>
>**sources** folder is  redundant as repository contains everything however I like -atleast for now- to have an explicit backup source copy of each deployed version.
