# Who is a Pipeline Technical Director

Pipeline Technical : <br>
In short he is the one who is responsible for making artists lives easier automating the daily routine processes as well as adding new or custom tools on demand. 

Pipeline Director : <br> 
the one who gives directions about how to do things and suggests new workflows.

## Skill and Responsibilities
In My opinion these points makes a successfull pipeline technical
1. Engineering Mindset [Fundamentals - Technical Skills] <br>
2. Engineering Practices and Principles [ Establish Goals - Create a Motivational Environment - Plan and Execute - ... ] <br>
3. DevOps [Team Management - Repo Management - Dev Process Management ] <br>
4. Pipeline Technical [DCCs APIs - Farm Management - Pipeline Tools/Automation - Flexibile Pipeline over local and remote networks  ] <br>

## P.S. 

     pipeline tools save a lot of headaches on artists as they won't need to remember a lot of logical steps 
     that don't relate to their art creation process.

### Pipeline Tools work on two levels :
- On OS Level to manage the interactions among DCC apps <br> 
e.g. save scene files , import assets , export assets 

          Note :
          a. Assets Naming Conventions are set explicitly by supervisors and pipeline technical.
          b. Scene files and assets export names can be set by pipeline tool automatically based on asset name.
- On DCC apps level which manages their inner components <br>
  e.g. Naming conventions for materials, 3d models and Rigs <br>
  e.g. Naming conventions for read and write nodes <br>
  e.g. Detect and fix common problems <br>
     
          Note :
          This kind of naming conventions are set explicitly by supervisors and TDs to keep every thing consistent.

## Plan :
- Virtual Machines : <br>
     > To mimic the basic structure of a studio's network. <br>

- Production Tools Vs Pipeline Tools :
     > Kitsu, AYON and PRISM2.0  <br>
       
- USD Workflow and Mateial X
