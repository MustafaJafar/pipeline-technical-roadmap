# Who is a Pipeline Technical Director

Pipeline Technical : <br>
In short he is the one who is responsible for making artists lives easier automating the daily routine processes as well as adding new or custom tools on demand. 

Pipeline Director : <br> 
The one who gives directions about how to do things and suggests new workflows.

## Skills and Responsibilities
In My opinion these points make a successfull **Pipeline Technical**
1. Engineering Mindset [Fundamentals - Technical Skills] <br>
2. Engineering Practices and Principles [ Establish Goals - Create a Motivational Environment - Plan and Execute - ... ] <br>
3. DevOps [Dev / TDs Team Management - Repo Management - Dev Process Management ] <br>
4. Pipeline Technical [DCCs APIs - Farm Management - Pipeline Tools/Automation - Flexibile Pipeline over local and remote networks  ] <br>

## P.S. 

     pipeline tools save a lot of headaches on artists as they won't need to remember a lot of logical steps 
     that don't relate to their art creation process.

### Glossary

- Dev Team : `Dev`elopment `Team` 
     >People who are responsible for writing scripts and creating new tools

- TD : `T`echnical `D`irector 
     >A Technical Director is a bridge between an artist and a developer, [read more](https://www.alexanderrichtertd.com/post/the-role-of-a-technical-director).

- Repository : (`repo` for short) 
     >`Repo` is a centralized digital storage that developers use to make and manage changes to an application’s source code, [read more](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/repo/).

- DevOps : `Dev`elopment `Op`eration`s`
     >DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity, [read more](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/).

- DCC : `D`igital `C`ontent `C`reation 
     
     >A DCC app is any app that we use to create a digital art / content *e.g. 3d models, 2d illustrations*

- API : `A`pplication `P`rogramming `I`nterface 
     
     >An API is a set of definitions and protocols to build and integrate application software. <br>
     >In other words, it defines how to interact with a certain program via coding.

### Pipeline Tools work on two levels :
- On OS Level to manage interactions among DCC apps <br> 
e.g. save scene files , import assets , export assets 

          Note :
          a. Assets Naming Conventions are set explicitly by supervisors and pipeline technical.
          b. Scene files and assets export names can be set by pipeline tool automatically based on asset name.
- On DCC apps level which manage their inner components <br>
  e.g. Naming conventions for materials, 3d models and Rigs <br>
  e.g. Naming conventions for read and write nodes <br>
  e.g. Detect and fix common problems <br>
     
          Note :
          This kind of naming conventions are set explicitly by supervisors and TDs to keep every thing consistent.

## Plan :
- Building the **"Software Engineer" Mindset**
     > Learn how to think, solve problems as well as build outstanding technical skills
- Learn DCC apps APIs
     > Build your **Arsenal of skills** and learn how to use code to interact with DCC apps.
- Virtual Machines : <br>
     > I used VMs to mimic the basic structure of a studio's network. <br>

- Production Tools Vs Pipeline Tools :
     > Learn to setup Kitsu, AYON(formerly OpenPype)  and PRISM 2.0 as well as learn how to use them. <br>
       
- USD Workflow and Mateial X
