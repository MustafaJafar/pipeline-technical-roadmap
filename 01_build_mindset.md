# Building the **"Software Engineer" Mindset**

From [The “Software Engineer” Mindset](https://techblog.bozho.net/the-software-engineer-mindset/)

The software engineer mindset is about solving the problem. The more senior you are, the faster you are in finding simpler solutions. The more technologies you are familiar with, the more non-localized solutions you are able to produce – in a multi-technology project. A solution that looks okay in one particular technology, may be a hack in the rest. 

The software engineer mindset is not saying “I don’t know about that, another colleague was doing it”. I’ve been getting answers like this on interviews – people have even been working on a certain part, and only knew the part they were working on for the past 2 years. How it fits with the rest is what the software engineer should be concerned with.

## In my opinion 

>No matter the number of python courses you study, you won't build a software engineer mindset. <br>

>No matter the more you study about a certain DCC, you won't build a software engineer mindset. <br>

>Although you can dig your own way as a pipeline technical without building such a mindset,<br>your life will be much easier as you will learn how to avoid mistakes and find solutions in<br>outstanding ways and you will also learn how to be smarter.  

### So, How to Build one! 

To name a few
