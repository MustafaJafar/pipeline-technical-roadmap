# DCC apps and APIs

To build a good **Arsenal of skills**  one needs to :

- Use DCCs as an Artist
- Read About CGI
- Use DCCs as a developer

## Use DCCs as an Artist

This is important for two reasons: <br>

- To learn how a DCC work
- To understand the big picture of a typical VFX pipeline 

You should learn the DCC first in order to be able to understand the effect of your code on it.
>In other words, you need to learn how to use Maya before digging in and creating Maya Scripts and tools! 

So, Give your self time to learn to use the DCC as an artist first<br><br>

Also, I recommend making a full project to understand the big picture of a typical VFX pipeline so that you can learn: 
  - what is the role of each department 
  - what is the input and output of each DCC
  - how to use each DCC 
  - what each artist do in their daily life at work
<br>

In this project I used DCCs like **Nuke**, **3d Equalizer**, **Houdini**, **Da Vinci Resolve** <br>
More Details: 
1) Set **aces color space** & do basic color corrention in **Nuke**
2) Camera tracking in **3d Equalizer** 
3) 3D scene setup & match lighting in **Houdini** 
4) Create 3d effects in **Houdini** & render in **RenderMan**
5) Composite in **Nuke**
6) Edit sound in **Audacity**
7) Color Grade in **Da Vinci Resolve**

## Read About CGI  :

Theory teaches you the experience of others. Theoretical knowledge can give you a deeper understanding of a concept through seeing it in the context of understanding the why behind it, [read more](https://vesim.ves.ac.in/vesimblog/student-blog/185-theoretical-knowledge-vs-practical-application.html).

So, learning how to usa a DCC is important, however reading about CGI adds another dimension to your knowledge.

 > Reading is Knowledge and Knowledge is Power

To name a few resources : 
- [CG Cinematography](https://chrisbrejon.com/) 
  > I really like the quailty of this book! 
- [RenderMan Learn](https://renderman.pixar.com/learn)
  > In this website, you can find general cgi articles as well as Renderman specific articles. <br>
  > Also, I admire that learning about renderman can teach you a lot about cgi. <br>
  > Undoubtedly, It's my favorite render engine . <br>
- [Cave Academy](https://caveacademy.com/)
  > It has a lot of amazing articles as well as high end courses! 
- [CG101 - Pluralsight](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxVq-O_gWqkAMpVv85pTSab6uKGw6sQz5) 
  > It's an example of CG fundamentals courses

## Use DCCs as a developer :

Artists can interact with programs using **GUI** "Graphical User Interface" in which a user interacts with graphical components such as icons, buttons, and menus with input devices *e.g. mouse, keyboard, graphic tablet*

Developers can interact with programs using **API** "Application Programming Interface" which defines how to interact with a certain program via coding. 

Example:<br>
You can write a python code that interacts with Maya via Maya API. <br>
In other words, you can write a python code to do some thing (e.g. create new objects) in Maya Scene. 

<br>

I found these websites and courses useful <br>
