Prism's philosophy to imitate the artist's daily workflow in an organized manner following the rules built into the Prism's logic.

In Prism you have three main Export categories where you select the type of output needed, it's much more natural for artists as it's almost like their daily practice.

Prism Doesn't require artist to follow certain configurations in the DCC file.

Therefore, Prism improves and automates the usual workflow of artists

Prism Export:
- playblast 
  - jpg 
  - mp4
  - avi
- export 
  - abc
  - obj
  - fbx
  - ma
  - shotcam (fbx + abc)
- image render (select layer)
  - exr
  - png
  - jpg

Openpype philosophy is to provide artists with a higher level of interaction with DCC since they **never have** to think about details such as output type, work location, and location of published data. Also, this data is more hidden.

In Openpype you have several export options (families) while creating a family Openpype will figure out what to do including running proper pre-export checks

Depending on the family type, Openpype requires artists to follow certain configurations in the DCC file.

Therefore, Openpype introduces a new concept for the daily workflow of artists.

Few examples of Openpype Families:
- review
- Model
- Point Cache
- Camera
