### Regarding Creating Custom paths/Project hierarchy on top of a pipeline management tool : 
          if you choose assets names and export names carfully, you won't need to create custom paths.
          you will be able to rely on the pipeline management tool.
          you won't need to make any custom database that maps asset names to their exported data.
          
          As Richard Frangenberg mentioned : 
          If Prism is using an actual database or checks the folder structure shouldn't make a difference for the code in your plugin.
          Implementing the optional use of a database is on the roadmap, but mostly for performance improvements.
